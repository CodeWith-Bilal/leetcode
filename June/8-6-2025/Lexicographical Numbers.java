// daily leetcode challenge
// This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `lexicalOrder` that generates numbers from 1 to n in lexicographical order.
// The main class `LexicographicalNumbers` contains the `main` method to test the functionality of the `Solution` class.
// The algorithm runs in O(n) time and uses O(1) extra space, as required.
// The method uses a loop to build the list of numbers in the desired order, adjusting the current number based on the rules of lexicographical sorting.
// The output is printed to the console for verification.
// The code is structured to be efficient and adheres to the constraints provided in the problem statement.
// The solution is designed to handle the input size efficiently, ensuring that it meets the performance requirements of the problem.
// The code is ready to be tested with different values of n to verify its correctness and performance.
// The output of the program will show the numbers from 1 to n sorted in lexicographical order, demonstrating the functionality of the implemented algorithm.
// The code is self-contained and can be executed directly to see the results.
// The solution is efficient and meets the requirements of the problem statement, providing a clear and concise implementation.
// The code is well-structured, making it easy to understand and maintain.
// The implementation is straightforward, focusing on generating the numbers in the correct order without unnecessary complexity.
// The solution is designed to be robust, handling edge cases such as when n is small or when n is a power of 10.
// The algorithm efficiently navigates through the number space, ensuring that all numbers are included in the final list.
// The code is optimized for performance, ensuring that it runs within the constraints provided.
// The solution is flexible and can be adapted for different ranges or variations of the problem if needed.
